## tiling window manager

I use i3wm, however, I wish to switch to something such as dwm in the future. I never use i3's floating windowss feature as I prefer the tiled layout. I prefer working with multiple workspaces, using workspace 3 for research because 3 is the easiest number to click (my i3 config removes gaps on workspace 3)

## keybinds

Most keybinds are the defaults from i3 (using Alt as the mod key), but there are some weird ones I configured for myself such as Mod+Shift+D to open discordo (a command-lnie versoin of Discord)

## applications

* [kitty](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/kitty) as a terminal emulator, [alacritty](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/alacritty) is an alternative
* [discordo](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/discordo-git) for Discord (keep in mind this breaks their TOS)
* [chromium](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/chromium) as a primary browser
* [nano](https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/nano) as a text editor, but [vim](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/vim) is preferred for programming
* [rofi](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/rofi) as a program launcher, [dmenu](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/dmenu) is an alternative
* [yay](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay) as an AUR helper

## wallpaper & status bar

I use [polybar](https://archlinuxarm.org/packages/aarch64/polybar) as a status bar, and it is currently set to a transparent background with a translucent fade in my wallpaper (shown below)
